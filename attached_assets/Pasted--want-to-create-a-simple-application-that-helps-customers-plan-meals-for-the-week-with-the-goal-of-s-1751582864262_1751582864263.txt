 want to create a simple application that helps customers plan meals for the week with the goal of saving time and saving money. They simply enter the people they want to plan for, the cooking equipment they have such as slow cookers, instant pots etc, the food likes and dislikes of the people and the goals for the weekly food, for example have the kids eat more vegetables. It should allow flexibility for amount of different dinners per day, for example it should allow them to select that they want 1 meal for the adults and something separate for the kids. Or that they have one person in the house that is vegetarian but the rest are not so a different meal for them. They also have the ability to select how many meals they want to cater for, ie dinners for 5 days or dinners, every meal for 7 days. They can also add the grocery store that they like to use. Once all options are selected the app will go and create an meal list and associated set of ingredients for the amount of meals they asked for. The app will always try to combine ingredients where possible in order to save food. It uses an AI LLM to do all of this. The user has the ability to select yes or no for each of the meals and the app will create a new meal, again trying to reuse ingredients. Once the user accepts all of the meals, it will then produce a combined grocery list for the week that: • Minimizes total cost by reusing ingredients across multiple recipes. • Clearly groups items by category (produce, meats, pantry, etc.). • Quantifies each ingredient exactly for the week’s needs. 3. Always look for ways to batch-cook or use leftovers creatively to reduce waste and save money. 4. Present each day’s plan in this format: - **Day X** • **Kids’ Dinner:** [Recipe title] – [Very brief description of how veg are hidden] • **Adults’ Dinner:** [Recipe title] – [Slow-cooker / stovetop; protein source] - **Grocery List (updated cumulatively):** • [Produce] • [Proteins] • [Pantry Staples] • [Dairy / Other]. Lastly it will create a shopping list that is grouped by aisle based on the grocery store the user entered, if none was entered it will not create this.
