- **API Endpoints**: Complete implementation with new dedicated endpoints
- **UI Components**: Full suite of components including modal, selectors, and specialized views
- **Data Flow**: Advanced ingredient consolidation with unit conversion and price estimation
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI-powered store organization and Instacart formatting

### Implemented Features
1. ✅ Unified ingredient access from any meal plan or meal plan group
2. ✅ Dual workflow options (Self Purchase & AI Purchase) 
3. ✅ AI-powered grocery store aisle organization for 9 major chains
4. ✅ Instacart-compatible formatting with copy-to-clipboard functionality
5. ✅ Smart unit conversion from cooking to grocery measurements
6. ✅ Shopping progress tracking with checkboxes and progress bars
7. ✅ Print-friendly layouts and downloadable shopping lists

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Unified Access Point**: Users can view consolidated ingredients from any meal plan (single or multi-plan)
2. **Purchase Option Selection**: Two distinct workflows for ingredient consumption
3. **Store-Specific Organization**: AI-powered aisle arrangement for selected grocery stores
4. **Instacart Integration**: Copy-ready format for ChatGPT Instacart operator

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see all my meal plan ingredients in one consolidated list

### AI Integration

#### Store Aisle Organization
```typescript
// OpenAI prompt for store organization
const storePrompt = `
Organize these grocery items by aisle for ${storeName}:

${ingredients.map(item => `${item.name} (${item.totalAmount} ${item.unit})`).join('\n')}

Return a JSON object with aisles as keys and arrays of items as values.
Use typical ${storeName} store layout. Group related items logically.

Example:
{
  "Produce": ["tomatoes", "onions"],
  "Dairy": ["milk", "cheese"],
  "Meat & Seafood": ["chicken breast"]
}
`;
```

#### Instacart Format Generation
```typescript
// OpenAI prompt for Instacart formatting
const instacartPrompt = `
Format this grocery list for ChatGPT Instacart operator.

Ingredients:
${ingredients.map(item => `${item.name}: ${item.totalAmount} ${item.unit}`).join('\n')}

Return in this exact format:
"Please add these items to my Instacart cart:
- [quantity] [item name]
- [quantity] [item name]

If any items are unavailable, please suggest similar alternatives.
Prefer organic options when available."
`;
```
